This is **Hangman** for the command line!

A game where you have to guess the secret word before you get hanged!☠️

I made this game as a project from the curriculum by [The Odin
Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization?ref=lnav).

Check them out for an awesome free curriculum about learning Web Development.
