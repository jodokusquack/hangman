This is **Hangman** for the command line!

A game where you have to guess the secret word before you get hanged!☠️

Type "save" at any point during the game to save and return to
it later at any point.

To play the game clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/jodokusquack/hangman.git
```

and then execute "hangman.rb".

Alternatively you can play it on [repl.it](https://repl.it/@jodokusquack/hangman). 
But you might be deleting other peoples games on there ;)

I made this game as a project from the curriculum by [The Odin
Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization?ref=lnav).

Check them out for an awesome free curriculum about learning Web Development.
